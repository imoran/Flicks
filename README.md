## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I felt that one of the most challenging things about this app was trying to figure out how to properly make the network error function. In order to do so, you must understand how it obtains information from the API, which was something I had to look at for a while. Customizing was also quite difficult, as well as the installing of the CocoaPods. It was a super fun app to build, nonetheless!
